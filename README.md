# Sedgewick Real Estate Company Website

### First Time Visitor Goals
  - A first time visitor should be able to clearly identify Sedgewick as a real estate sales firm specializing in buyers’ representation and doing business in the Southbay area of Southern California.
  - A first time visitor should be able to easily navigate throughout the site in a simple and intuitive way. 
  - A first time visitor should be able to quickly see that Sedgewick specializes in buyer’s representation of a real estate transaction. This is important because it will help pinpoint the message of the site to the desired client, efficiently eliminating the need to continue browsing the site if the first time visitor is a person interested in selling their real estate. 
  - A first time visitor should be able to search through some real estate listings in order to get an idea of the type of buying options available in the area. 
- A first time visitor should easily be able to determine what price point they are most comfortable with in buying their next property. 
- A first time visitor will easily be able to contact Sedgewick real estate broker agents to begin their real estate search, making their preferences known and providing as much detail as they want about their search.
- A first time visitor should be able to access resources designed to inform them about and facilitate the purchase of their next home. 

### Returning Visitor Goals
  - A returning visitor’s purpose for visiting the Sedgewick website would be to review and download the resource guides provided in the site and/or to make use of the mortgage calculator available. These resources are easily accessible at the footer, which is repeated on every page of the site.
  
### Design
  #### Color Scheme
  - The main colors used will be gray, white, and orange (specifically, RGB (243, 172, 80).
  #### Typography
  - The font families used for this site will be Oswald and Lato throughout the site, with San Serif as the fallback font if such font family is not being imported. 
  #### Imagery 
  - Imagery is important. The large, background hero image on the main page is designed to be impactful and clearly identify the area as a Southern California community. This is achieved with an overview shot of the beachside of the Southbay community. A more powerful impact is achieved by adding a forward hero-zoom animation to the image.
- Header imagery is intentionally limited throughout the site in order to focus the visitor’s attention to the content and purpose of each page. 
- Photos of real estate properties for sale are important to draw the visitor’s attention and peak their interest in contacting Sedgewick.
